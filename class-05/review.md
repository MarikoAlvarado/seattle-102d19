## HTML & Wireframe

- Foundation
- Using structure provided made it easier
- Worked first time
- Validating and awesome
- Wireframe and labes helped create the structure
- Wireframe is the direction of where we are going

- Tried to link pages and worked great

<body> - Keep everything?  This is where the content of our page goes.
<!DOCTYPE html> - Tells the browser what it is reading and to expect HTML
<head> - Title, link css, link js, meta, sizeing data

3 areas in the body? header, main, footer
